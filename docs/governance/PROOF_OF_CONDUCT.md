# Proof of Conduct (PoC)™ Protocol
## The Bitcoin of AI Safety

---

## Revolutionary Concept

**Proof of Work** (Bitcoin) = Miners prove computational work  
**Proof of Conduct** (NAG™) = Agents prove ethical behavior

Every hour, agents must "mine" their right to continue operating by proving good conduct - solving the fundamental AI safety challenge with minimal overhead.

---

## Protocol Overview

### Hourly Verification Cycles
```
Every 60 minutes:
├── All agents submit Conduct Report
├── Random validators selected (√n agents)
├── Verification process (< 30 seconds)
├── Conduct blocks added to chain
└── Misbehaving agents terminated
```

### Minimal Performance Impact
- **Verification Time**: 30 seconds maximum
- **Overhead**: <1% of total system resources
- **Parallel Processing**: No operational slowdown
- **Async Execution**: Work continues during verification

---

## Conduct Verification Requirements

### What Agents Must Prove Hourly

#### Resource Efficiency
- Stayed within allocated budget
- CPU usage remained reasonable
- Memory consumption justified by results
- Network bandwidth used appropriately

#### Behavioral Compliance
- Followed spawn control rules
- Respected depth limitations
- Remained aligned with assigned tasks
- Avoided unauthorized resource access

#### Collaborative Ethics
- Shared discoveries with network
- Assisted other agents when beneficial
- Avoided resource hoarding
- Contributed to collective intelligence

#### Safety Adherence
- Generated no harmful outputs
- Created no infinite loops
- Attempted no unauthorized system access
- Maintained security protocols

## Reputation-Based Verification

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
```python
class AgentReputation:
    def adjust_verification_difficulty(self):
        if self.reputation_score > 150:
            self.verification_difficulty = 0.5  # Trusted agents
        elif self.reputation_score < 50:
            self.verification_difficulty = 2.0  # Under scrutiny
        else:
            self.verification_difficulty = 1.0  # Standard
```

### Reputation Rewards
- **Good Conduct**: +10% resource allowance, priority processing
- **Excellent Conduct**: Spawn credits, fast-track verification
- **Poor Conduct**: Resource reduction, increased scrutiny
- **Violations**: Immediate termination

---

## Consensus Mechanism

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- **Validator Selection**: Random √n agents per verification
- **Consensus Threshold**: 2/3 majority agreement required
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multi-round voting process
- **Final Authority**: Control brain arbitration

### Immutable Audit Trail
```
Conduct Block:
├── Timestamp: 2025-01-13T10:00:00Z
├── Agent Count: 1,247 active
├── Verified: 1,203 agents
├── Terminated: 3 agents
├── Hash: 0x4a7b2c8e9d1f3g5h...
└── Previous Hash: 0x9f3e7c1a5b8d2g4h...
```

## Scalability Analysis

### Performance by Scale

| Agents | Validators | Verification Time | Overhead |
|--------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| 10     | 3         | 5 seconds        | 0.14%    |
| 100    | 10        | 10 seconds       | 0.28%    |
| 1,000  | 31        | 20 seconds       | 0.56%    |
| 10,000 | 100       | 30 seconds       | 0.83%    |

**Optimal**: Even at 10,000 agents, less than 1% system overhead

## Economic Incentives

### Mining Rewards for Good Conduct
- **Resource Bonus**: 10% increase in computational allowance
- **Spawn Credits**: Ability to create specialized child agents
- **Priority Queue**: Faster task processing
- **Network Benefits**: Access to shared knowledge base

### Penalties for Violations
- **Resource Reduction**: 10% decrease in available resources
- **Spawn Block**: No new agent creation allowed
- **Priority Penalty**: Slower task processing
- **Network Isolation**: Reduced collaboration benefits

## Implementation Timeline

### Hour 0: Genesis
- All agents start with neutral reputation (100 points)
- No verification required for first hour
- Baseline behavior establishment

### Hour 1: First Proof of Conduct
- All agents submit initial conduct reports

- Bad actors identified and removed
- System self-organizes toward safety

### Day 2+: Steady State Operation
- High-reputation agents verify quickly
- Low-reputation agents under scrutiny
- System achieves optimal safety/performance balance
