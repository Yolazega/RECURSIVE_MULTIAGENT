# NAG™ System Architecture Overview
## Revolutionary Neural Network Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

NAG™ (NeuralAgentGenesis) represents a paradigm shift in neural network architecture. By implementing neurons as intelligent agents rather than mathematical functions, we achieve unprecedented depth and efficiency in computational problem-solving.

## Core Innovation: Agents as Neurons

### Traditional Neural Networks
```
Neuron = Simple mathematical function
Input → Weights × Activation → Output
Limitations:
- Gradient vanishing at depth
- Fixed topology
- No reasoning capability
```

### NAG™ Neural Networks
```
Neuron = Intelligent AI Agent
Input → Reasoning → Decision → Action → Output
Capabilities:
- Complete context retention
- Self-organizing topology
- Economic decision making
- Recursive spawning
```
